**The CSS text rendering** property is a mixed bag. On initial pass it seems to be an obvious choice for improving type on the web.

However after a bit of reading there are known [bugs](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/issues/78 "HTML5 Boilerplate GitHub") in some [browsers](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=114719 "Chromium Issues"), [operating systems](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15067 "Android Issues") and [performance issues](http://www.marco.org/2012/11/15/text-rendering-optimize-legibility "Marco.org") on Android and older versions of iOS.<sup>[1](#fn1)</sup>

There are four values that text rendering can be set to <sup>[2](#fn2)</sup>:

1. `auto`: The browser renders the text based on when to optimize for speed, legibility, and geometric precision.
2. `optimizeSpeed`: The browser renders text for speed over the other values. It disables kerning and ligatures.
3. `optimizeLegibility`: The browser renders text for legibility over the other values. This enables kerning and optional ligatures.
4. `geometricPrecision`: The browser renders text for geometric precision over rendering speed and legibility.

So Iâ€™ve been playing around with just setting Legibility to headings and blockquotes. Keeping it to large sized and short pieces of text.
